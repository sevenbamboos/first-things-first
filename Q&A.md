# What kind of feature will be included in the first version?
Scan a fold and list a summary of all unfinished things.

# When will the first version be released?
If everything is fine, the coding would begin early next month (May in 2018). But the end date is still not decided, maybe it needs one or two weeks depending on how much free time I could have.

# Is there any plan for further version?
It's hard to say for now (Apr 2018).
